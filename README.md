# Modi Lies
[modilies.in](https://www.modilies.in/) is a really great resource which is
trying to track all the lies that our GOD-like leader has said over the years.
I wanted this info in a structured format so I conld spam it on various social
medias.

# WHY?
It's fun! (Read the section below for a more through and serious answer).

## Fire-hosing of falsehood

In 2016, Christopher Paul and Miriam Matthews wrote a paper for RAND
Corporation, an American think-tank, in which they analysed propaganda
techniques used by the Vladimir Putin government in Russia. They called it the
“Firehose of Falsehood” (read it here). The Russian model is not to simply make
you believe a lie — the lie is often so obviously a lie, you’d be a fool to
believe it. The idea is to “entertain, confuse and overwhelm” the audience.

They identified four distinct features of the Putin propaganda model, all of
which are true for the Modi propaganda machinery as well, as they are for
Donald Trump’s.

1) High volume and multi-channel
2) Rapid, continuous and repetitive
3) Lacks commitment to objective reality
4) Lacks commitment to consistency


## How to fight the fire-hosing of falsehood
The RAND corporation researchers also suggest five ways for the United States
to counter the Russian “fire-hosing of falsehood”. These are applicable to any
actor who undertakes this propaganda model, including Modi and Trump.

1. First Information Report
2. **Highlight the lying, not just the lies**
3. Identify and attack the goal of the propaganda
4. Compete
5. Turn off the tap

This is an attempt to highlight these lies.
